# My Responsive Portfolio Website ###

## Bootstrap

To assist in a quick and efficient design, I used bootstrap to build the website. Bootstrap is a massive database of premade classes and elements that you can build a functioning, responsive website in a fraction of the time it takes to write out all the code yourself.

## Responsive Design

My portfolio website was designed with multiple devices in mind. Breakpoints are the points at which a website shifts in design to accomadate different screen sizes and devices. I designed the responsiveness around the three breakpoint sizes:
- **Large** - Roughly equivalent to the size of a laptop screen and the breakpoint is at a width greater than or equal to 992 pixels.
- **Medium** - The size of many tablet screens and the breakpoint is at a width of 768 pixels.
- **Small/Extra Small** - Contains the size of many mobile devices. The breakpoint is at 576 pixels, with anything greater than 576, but less than 768 is classified as small and less than 576 is extra small. I designed the website's smallest size around 400 pixels keeping the smaller devices in mind.

## Div Tag Replaced

The 'div' tags were reordered and replaced with HTML semantic elements: 
  - **header** - Contains a heading element for the entire page or within another parent tag.
  - **nav** - Containing all the elements of the navbar at the top of the window.
  - **figure** - Tag in general for images; all portfolio images are contained in figure tags.
  - **section** - A portion of a page/larger section.
  - **article** - Tag contains things that could be displayed independantly of the rest of the page and still make sense.
  - **footer** - The footer/bottom of the page.
